# tibetan-unicode-converter

A naive attempt at processing gibberish into Unicode Tibetan.

Almost all Tibetan characters should be properly transcoded but only a few
Sanskrit characters are currently handled.

Getting started
-----------

Just copy the repository locally.

Usage
-----------

### As a library

```js
new TibetanUnicodeConverter('oe×ñÎ >ë-{,-8ß:-bÜ-¹¥/-e$-020<Î').convert()
=> 'ཧཱུྃ༔ ཨོ་རྒྱན་ཡུལ་གྱི་ནུབ་བྱང་མཚམས༔'
```

### As a tool

#### `index.html`

![Demo](./docs/index-small.jpg)

* Open `index.html`
* Fill in the left box with your gibberish
* Click the *Copy to clipboard* button to copy the converted Unicode Tibetan.

Testing
-----------

![Demo](./docs/tests-small.jpg)

* Open `tests.html`
* Categories can be clicked to reveal their test cases.
* To ease debugging, clicking a tibetan case on the right side will re-run the
  test for just that particular case.

Credits
-----------

A zillion thanks to:
* Tony Duff and friends for producing all these beautiful Tibetan fonts.
* Everybody involved in building an maintaining Vue.js, jQuery, SemanticUI,
  Sugar.js, Underscore.js, DevDocs, Zeal and Google Chrome for making web
  development so easy and enjoyable.

otherwise reach absolute freedom.
